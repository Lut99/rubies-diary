# Introduction

Dear diary,

Don't tell Tweed, but sometimes I just need vent my heart to somebody other than him! He's very nice, but also a little dramatic, and definitely hung up with killing vampires. No, sometimes I need to document our crazy adventures somewhere else. Which is why I stole you from a wizard's tower somewhere!

For now, though, we're in a bit of quiet spot, so not much to document yet. But I'm sure something will turn up soon...

Love,  
Ruby


P.S. Note to self: I can check out my adventures in the sidebar to the left, under the hamburger menu.

Wait, what is making me write that. Is this dairy... magic?
